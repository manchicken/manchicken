## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Mike Stemle (he/him), and I enjoy reading and writing code. I'm a software professional with more than 25 years of professional programming experience. I'm an open source expert with a love for community, technology, and what we can do when we work together.

[![GitHub Trends SVG](https://api.githubtrends.io/user/svg/manchicken/repos?time_range=one_year&theme=synthwaves)](https://githubtrends.io)

See? While I have done a lot in my years, I'm not done yet!

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ideas on where I can go from here in my open source journey. Advice, writing, code, all are things I'd love to contribute more of.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my [promise-regulation](https://github.com/manchicken/promise-regulation) module. I think it's an interesting little way of thinking about how we would like to better control concurrency and asynchronicity in JavaScript.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m working on diving deeper Rust. There's an awful lot of room to grow in this space, and it's a really interesting language.
- ðŸ§¬ I'm learning Helix. It's the first new editor I've learned in a _while_, so I'm excited to learn something new.

## Hacktoberfest 2023 Projects

Here are a list of projects I'm involved with during Hacktoberfest:

### Stuff I'm working on

- I'm working on the Datadog Service Catalog Metadata Provider (DDSCMP) which can be found here: https://github.com/arcxp/datadog-service-catalog-metadata-provider
- I'm working on a project called "repository-wrapup" which is intended to help you find and address abandoned code repositories on GitHub.

### Stuff I invite you to work on if you'd like

- I could use a hand with documetation for my `@manchicken/promise-regulation` module. You can find that here: https://github.com/manchicken/promise-regulation
  - Documentation is really needed
  - If you can think of some tests I didn't think of, that'd be marvelous
- If you're a user of the DDSCMP, and you'd like to participate, you can also contribute here: https://github.com/arcxp/datadog-service-catalog-metadata-provider
  - Take a look a the issues list
  - There is a _lot_ of documentation for this project, there are bound to be mistakes. I welcome all PRs correcting those mistakes.
