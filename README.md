### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Mike Stemle (he/him), and I enjoy reading and writing code. I'm a software professional with more than 25 years of professional programming experience. I'm an open source expert with a love for community, technology, and what we can do when we work together.

See? While I have done a lot in my years, I'm not done yet!

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ideas on where I can go from here in my open source journey. Advice, writing, code, all are things I'd love to contribute more of.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my [promise-regulation](https://github.com/manchicken/promise-regulation) module. I think it's an interesting little way of thinking about how we would like to better control concurrency and asynchronicity in JavaScript.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust, and all of the fun things that can be done with Rust. There's an awful lot of room to grow in this space, and it's a really interesting language.
