## Hacktoberfest 2023 Projects

Here are a list of projects I'm involved with during Hacktoberfest:

### Stuff I'm working on

- I'm working on the Datadog Service Catalog Metadata Provider (DDSCMP) which can be found here: https://github.com/arcxp/datadog-service-catalog-metadata-provider
- I'm working on a project called "repository-wrapup" which is intended to help you find and address abandoned code repositories on GitHub.

### Stuff I invite you to work on if you'd like

- I could use a hand with documetation for my `@manchicken/promise-regulation` module. You can find that here: https://github.com/manchicken/promise-regulation
  - Documentation is really needed
  - If you can think of some tests I didn't think of, that'd be marvelous
- If you're a user of the DDSCMP, and you'd like to participate, you can also contribute here: https://github.com/arcxp/datadog-service-catalog-metadata-provider
  - Take a look a the issues list
  - There is a _lot_ of documentation for this project, there are bound to be mistakes. I welcome all PRs correcting those mistakes.
